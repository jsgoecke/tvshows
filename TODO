To do list :


* Know bugs
- Azureus launches but does not load torrents (sometimes?)


* High priority (before next release):
- User-agent (tvshows #version)
- don't start checking at :00
- gzip
- launchd[1423]: net.sourceforge.tvshows: execve(): No such file or directory ??

* Medium priority:
- BSG bug ?
- handle NSInvalidArgumentException when launching a NSTask
- unit test for : show list, getdetails, parseRssFeed
- Check for a Bittorrent client at startup
- Change @"CFBundle..." with kCFBundle
- Use sparkle for updates
- Refresh show list (merge !)
- Do a TVShows.plist updater
- put GPL in code
- uninstaller
- check if file downloaded is really a torrent (might be HTML with "this torrent does not exist)


* Low priority:
- Calendar integration?
- Nicer version checker
- Handle double-click on table rows
- Check the plist with a DTD?



* Feature requests:
- when updating shows, highlight (or something) the new ones.
- open Bittorrent client in the background
- IMDB/Wikipedia info
- per shows preferences
- organize shows in folders (download the torrents in separate folders + see if you can tell the client the destination ?)
